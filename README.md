# App Notes

- This application is only partially complete. The search form ,image container and the main App component provide a partial example of how to structure an app and to communicate between components.

- TODO: - in order to really complete this app the following needs to be completed:

  1. Get the pagination component set up.
  
  2. Add communication between the paginator, app and image container components to facilitate delivery of 12
  images at a time to the image container depending on page. 
  
  3. Style the app.
